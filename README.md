# SAiDL Season Of Code

We invite applications for the following projects from (1st/2nd/3rd) year students. Chosen students will get to work closely in a research environment with high development through Open Source Software. 

## Projects
### 1. Deep Contextual Bandits
#### Description
Contextual Bandits are a subset of algorithms in Reinforcement Learning which aim at optimization in content personalization using user data. Due to their extremely low compute, memory requirements and scalibilty, they're used on device at the "edge" like mobile phones to massive service products like Azure. There are a lot of limitations of these algorithms. The project aims at trying to alleviate these problems and solving much more complex problems by augmenting these Bandit algorithms with Deep Networks.
#### Deliverables
A good amount of understanding of the core algorithms which are used in the industry. A short term goal would be Open Source package developments. An achievable long term goal could be publication(s) in OSS conferences/journals and in exceptional cases Machine Learning workshops/conferences.

### 2. Open Source python package Adversarial NLP 
#### Description
We are aiming to build a lite python package to perform transforms on speech and text data for black-box adversarial attacks on NLP models. A very good starting point in this very interesting topic would be this: https://github.com/thunlp/TAADpapers . Work will involve writing a modular code for adversarial transforms, adversarial debugging of NLP models and scripting examples for the use of written code on state-of-the-art NLP models.
#### Deliverables
Any contributing member can expect good open-source and advanced NLP related experience on his/her profile. For the initial stage of the work, we are aiming for implementing some easy survey papers on Adversarial NLP. For a long-term , we might come up with our own analysis and techniques, pushing the work towards a dataset/resources related platform (Ex: LREC conference)
